## Overview
Banks want customers to invest in long term deposits for several reasons. They include providing the bank with a stable source of funding for their lending activities, managing their liquidity, reduced cost of funds and providing a more predictable source of revenue because with long term accounts. Banks can anticipate the interest income they will earn over a specific period, allowing them to plan and allocate resources more effectively. Other benefits are increased cross-selling opportunities: Once a customer has invested in a long term deposit account, banks can offer them other financial products and services, such as loans, mortgages, credit cards, and investment products. This creates opportunities for cross-selling, which can help banks generate additional revenue.

Overall, long term deposits benefit both banks and customers, providing banks with stable funding sources and customers with higher interest rates and investment options.

## Business Problem
A bank is experiencing a decline in revenue and seeking to boost it by increasing long term deposits. They intend to identify existing customers who are most likely to open long term deposits accounts. The bank collected data through telemarketing. The objective of the project is to develop a classification model that can predict whether a customer will open a long term deposit account or not. The analysis and model will help the bank in target market segmentation, thus increasing their conversion rate, and in extension, the revenue.

## Data Modeling
Four classification algorithms were used: 
>1. DecisionTreeClassifier
>2. LogisticRegression
>3. RandomForestClassifier
>4. K- Nearest Neighbor

## Data Evaluation
The team focused on accuracy and presicion metrics to evaluate the models.
